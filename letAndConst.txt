1. const PI = 3.14;
2. var is function scoped vs block scoped. var can also be redeclared.
3. same as above, except const is assigned a value at creation that cannot be altered.
4. that let can be reassigned whereas const cannot.
5. some browser compilation of JS quirk where all vars are read first so that variable references for these variables are able to be 
referenced before declaration and outside any scope.
